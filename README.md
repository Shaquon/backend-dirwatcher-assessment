 This is dirwatcher our objective is to: 

- Create a long running program
- Demonstrate signal handling
- Demonstrate program logging
- Use exception handling to keep the program running
- Create and structure your own code repository using best practices
- Show that you know how to read a set of requirements and deliver on them, 
  asking for clarification if anything is unclear.


  Other Criteria:

- Use all best-practices that have been taught so far: docstrings, PEP8, unit tests, clean and readable code and meaningful commit messages.

- Have a demonstrable OS signal handler
- Log messages for files with magic text
-  Handle and log different exceptions such as file-not-found, directory-not-exist as well as handle and report  
   top-level unknown exceptions so that your program stays alive.
- Include a startup and shutdown banner in your logs and report the total runtime (uptime) within your shutdown log 
  banner.  Please see the hints below if you don't understand what a logging banner is.
